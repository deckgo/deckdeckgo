                    <h2>10. Reserved Names</h2>

                    <p>DeckDeckGo has the right to maintain a list of reserved names which will not be made publicly available. These reserved names may be set aside for purposes of proactive trademark protection, avoiding user confusion, security measures, or any other reason (or no reason).</p>
