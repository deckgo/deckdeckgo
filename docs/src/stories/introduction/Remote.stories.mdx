# Remote Control

Your slides can be controlled with a [remote control] ðŸ“±.

## How does it work

If you are using the starter kit, out of the box, your presentation will signal itself as "controllable" and will therefore be "discoverable". We are using a small NodeJS server for surch purpose.

Once the presentation is linked to the [remote control], the communication between these will happen through a real-time channel using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org/).

## Privacy

No data are exchanged as long as you do not grant access to your slides. A random number will be used to request a connection from the [remote control] to your deck. Such requests can be accepted or cancelled. A popup will appear for such purpose over your presentation.

## Give it a try

Better than a long description, the DeckDeckGo demo website implements a deck and receiver to let you interact with this application, just give it a try:

1. Open the DeckDeckGo demo website ðŸ‘‰ https://demo.deckdeckgo.com
2. Start the [remote control] PWA ðŸ‘‰ https://deckdeckgo.app
3. Have fun ðŸŽ‰

## Time tracker

The [remote control] lets you track your talk's time too. This application implements local notifications to inform you when your talk is about to finish or is finished.
