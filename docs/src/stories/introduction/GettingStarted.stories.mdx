# Getting started

[DeckDeckGo] provides a [CLI](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/tree/master/cli), [starter kit](https://github.com/deckgo/starter) to create presentations and a [template kit](https://github.com/deckgo/template-kit) to develop your own templates.

> [DeckDeckGo] requires a recent LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and npm.

## Start a new presentation

Run the following command in a terminal to create a new deck and follow the prompt:

```bash
npm init deckdeckgo
```
