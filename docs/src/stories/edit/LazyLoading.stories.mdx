# Lazy loading

[DeckDeckGo] is built for performance and tries to lazy load as much as possible the components of your presentation. Have a look at the Lighthouse score of the [DeckDeckGo] website for reference.

In order to lazy load the images of your presentation, you could either use our dead simple component or tweak your images' attributes like the following example below.

[DeckDeckGo] handles the lazy loading of images provided in both forms.

## Lazy Image component

Here's an example of usage of our component:

```
<deckgo-lazy-img img-src="https://deckdeckgo.com/assets/favicon/android-chrome-512x512.png">
</deckgo-lazy-img>
```

## Tweak Image Tag

Instead of providing the url of your images as `src`, which would trigger an instant loading of their content, please provide their url using the attribute `data-src`.

```
<img data-src="https://deckdeckgo.com/assets/favicon/android-chrome-512x512.png"/>
```
