# RTL Support

[DeckDeckGo] offers full LTR and RTL support. The deck inherits its parent text direction.

Commonly, if you wish to use RTL for all of your pages in the presentation, you could set the attribute `dir` of the root `html` tag to `rtl`.

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html dir="rtl">
<body>
  <deckgo-deck>
  </deckgo-deck>
</body>
</html>
```
