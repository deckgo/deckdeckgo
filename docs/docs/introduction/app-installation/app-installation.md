# Installation

To create easily your PWA presentation and to enjoy all the options, I suggest you to create your slides using the CLI and the starter kit as described in the [previous chapter](/docs/introduction).

However, the [DeckDeckGo] core component, could be installed in any project too.

If you wish to do so, use it directly in your project from a CDN, using a simple script include, or install it from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deckdeckgo).

It's recommended to use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) to use the [DeckDeckGo] from a CDN. To do so, add the following include script in the main HTML file of your project:

```
<script src="https://unpkg.com/deckdeckgo@latest/dist/deckdeckgo.js"></script>
```

## Install DeckDeckGo from NPM

Install [DeckDeckGo] in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/deckdeckgo) using the following command:
