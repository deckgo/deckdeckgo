# Getting started

[DeckDeckGo] provides a [CLI](https://github.com/deckgo/create-deckdeckgo) and a [starter kit](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo-starter).

## Prerequisites

[DeckDeckGo] requires a recent LTS version of [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) and npm. Make sure you've installed and/or updated Node before continuing.

> Note that you will need to use npm 6 or higher

## Starting a new presentation

Run the following command in a terminal to create a new deck:

```bash
npm init deckdeckgo
```

After running init you will be provided with a prompt so that you can set the base information for your new deck and choose if you rather like to edit it in **HTML** or **markdown**:

```bash
Cool, let's kick start a new DeckDeckGo presentation

? What's your project name (will be use to create a new folder)? (deckdeckgo)

? What's your presentation name (max. 45 characters, will be use for meta tags and manifest information)? (DeckDeckGo)

? What's your presentation about (its description)? (Create a lightweight presentation using Web Components 🚀)

? What's your name (will be use for the author meta information)? (David)

? What method do you want to use to edit your presentation? (Use arrow keys)
  ❯ HTML 
    Markdown
```

Once your presentation created, go to your new project's folder and start editing your slides and content for your talk 😉
