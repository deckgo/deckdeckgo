# Slide: QR Code

The "QR code" slide is an handy slide in case you would like to display a QR code. It could for example be use as the very last slide of your presentation to display an easy link pointing to your deck, you previously published online. It would allow your audience to get easily your slides without any delay on their phone.

## Installation

> If you are using our Starter Kit, no need to worry about this, this template is included, therefore you could skip the "Installation" chapter.
 
### From a CDN

It's recommended to use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) to use this template from a CDN. To do so, add the following include script in the main HTML file of your project:

```
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/slide-qrcode@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-slide-qrcode/deckdeckgo-slide-qrcode.esm.js"></script>
<script nomodule="" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/slide-qrcode@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-slide-qrcode/deckdeckgo-slide-qrcode.js"></script>
```

### From NPM

To install this template in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deckdeckgo/core) run the following command:

```bash
npm install @deckdeckgo/slide-qrcode
```

### Framework integration

The [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) provide examples of framework integration for [Angular](https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular), [React](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react), [Vue](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue) and [Ember](https://stenciljs.com/docs/ember).

That being said, commonly, you might either `import` or `load` it:

#### Import

```
import '@deckdeckgo/slide-qrcode';
```

#### Loader

```
import { defineCustomElements as deckDeckGoSlideElement } from '@deckdeckgo/slide-qrcode/dist/loader';
deckDeckGoSlideElement(window);
```

## Usage

The "QR code" slide's Web Component could be integrated using the tag `<deckgo-slide-qrcode/>`.

### Usage

```
<deckgo-deck>
  <deckgo-slide-qrcode content="https://deckdeckgo.com">
    <h1 slot="title">My QR code</h1>
    <p slot="content">An optional additional content</p>
  </deckgo-slide-code>
</deckgo-deck>  
```

### Slots

The slots `title` and `content` are optional.

### Notes

Optionally a slot `notes` could be use to add some notes regarding the particular slide. These will be automatically `displayed` in the [remote control](https://deckdeckgo.app).

If you are using the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit and wish to make your notes accessible to anyone, you would need to mark them with an attribute `show`.

## Code components

The slide "QR Code" relies on the code component `<deckgo-qrcode/>` which is described in the components [documentation](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/blob/master/doc/components/components.md).

## Installation

The [DeckDeckGo] - QR Code component is provided in separate extra library. If you don't use the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit and wish to add the [DeckDeckGo] QR code to your project, you will need to install and integrate it from a CDN or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deckdeckgo/qrcode) as described in its [installation guide](https://docs.deckdeckgo.com/components/qrcode#app-components-qrcode-getting-started).

## Attributes

The attribute `content` should be provided in order to render a QR code in this template. It offers the same attributes as the [DeckDeckGo] QR code Web Component, see its [documentation](https://docs.deckdeckgo.com/components/qrcode) for the details, and the following other attributes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
| Attribute                      | Type   | Default   | Description   |
| -------------------------- |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| custom-background | boolean | false | If you would provide a background for the all deck and a specific one for this slide, set this option to `true` |
| custom-actions | boolean | false | If you would provide actions for the all deck and a specific one for this slide, set this option to `true` |

### Example without any slots

```
<deckgo-deck>
  <deckgo-slide-qrcode content="An encoded text">
  </deckgo-slide-code>
</deckgo-deck>  
```
