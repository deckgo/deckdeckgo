# Slide: QR Code

The "QR code" slide is an handy slide in case you would like to display a QR code.

<div class="container ion-margin">
  <deckgo-deck embedded={true}>
    <deckgo-slide-qrcode content="https://deckdeckgo.com">
        <h1 slot="title">slot="title"</h1>
        <p slot="content">slot="content"</p>
    </deckgo-slide-qrcode>
  </deckgo-deck>
</div>

## Usage

The "QR code" slide's Web Component could be integrated using the tag `<deckgo-slide-qrcode/>`.

### Usage

```
<deckgo-deck>
  <deckgo-slide-qrcode content="https://deckdeckgo.com">
    <h1 slot="title">My QR code</h1>
    <p slot="content">An optional additional content</p>
  </deckgo-slide-code>
</deckgo-deck>  
```

### Slots

The slots `title` and `content` are optional.

### Notes

Optionally a slot `notes` could be use to add some notes regarding the particular slide. These will be automatically `displayed` in the [remote control](https://deckdeckgo.app).

If you are using the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit and wish to make your notes accessible to anyone, you would need to mark them with an attribute `show`.

## Code components

The slide "QR Code" relies on the code component `<deckgo-qrcode/>` which is described in the components [documentation](https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo/blob/master/doc/components/components.md).

## Installation

The [DeckDeckGo] - QR Code component is provided in separate extra library. If you don't use the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit and wish to add the [DeckDeckGo] QR code to your project, you will need to install and integrate it from a CDN or [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deckdeckgo/qrcode) as described in its [installation guide](https://docs.deckdeckgo.com/components/qrcode#app-components-qrcode-getting-started).

## Attributes

The attribute `content` should be provided in order to render a QR code in this template. It offers the same attributes as the [DeckDeckGo] QR code Web Component, see its [documentation](https://docs.deckdeckgo.com/components/qrcode) for the details, and the following other attributes:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        
| Attribute                      | Type   | Default   | Description   |
| -------------------------- |-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| custom-background | boolean | false | If you would provide a background for the all deck and a specific one for this slide, set this option to `true` |
| custom-actions | boolean | false | If you would provide actions for the all deck and a specific one for this slide, set this option to `true` |

### Example without any slots

```
<deckgo-deck>
  <deckgo-slide-qrcode content="An encoded text">
  </deckgo-slide-code>
</deckgo-deck>  
```
