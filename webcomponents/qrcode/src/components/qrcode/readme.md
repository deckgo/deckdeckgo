# deckgo-qrcode

The "QR Code" component is an extra component which let you add QR code in your slides, useful for example to display links and url and if you wish your audience to easily access them.

To generate the QR code, the project [qrcode-generator](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase/qrcode-generator) from [Kazuhiko Arase](https://github.com/kazuhikoarase) is used.

## Installation

This component can be added to your web application with following methods.

### Using DeckDeckGo QR Code from a CDN

It's recommended to use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) to use the [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com) Code from a CDN. To do so, add the following include script in the main HTML file of your project:

```
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/qrcode@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-qrcode/deckdeckgo-qrcode.esm.js"></script>
```

### Install DeckDeckGo QR Code from NPM

Install [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com) - QR Code in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deckdeckgo/qrcode) using the following command:

```bash
npm install @deckdeckgo/qrcode
```

### Framework integration

The [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) provide examples of framework integration for [Angular](https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular), [React](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react), [Vue](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue) and [Ember](https://stenciljs.com/docs/ember).

That being said, commonly, you might either `import` or `load` it:

#### Import

```
import '@deckdeckgo/qrcode';
```

#### Loader

```
import { defineCustomElements as deckDeckGoElement } from '@deckdeckgo/qrcode/dist/loader';
deckDeckGoElement();
```

## Usage

The `<deckgo-qrcode/>` Web Component will generate per default a `<svg/>` QR code with a correction level set to high.

Optionally, it's also possible to generate the QR code as an `<img/>` and/or to display a logo over it.

## QR Code with logo

It's possible to display a logo over your QR Code as the code generated with this Web Component have a correction level set to high meaning, if I understand correctly, that your content is encoded and displayed multiple times inside the QR code. Therefore, even if the logo cover a part of it, it will be still possible for a reader to read the content from "somewhere else" in the code.

However, test it carefully and play with the colours, cell-size and size of your code to ensure its readability.
