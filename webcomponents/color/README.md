# DeckDeckGo - Color Picker

The "Color Picker" component is a simple component to, guess what, allow your users to "pick colors" ðŸ˜‰

It is fully configurable in terms of colors, you could define the set of colors you rather like to offer and it also implements a "more" action which, if clicked, will open the platform standard color picker.
