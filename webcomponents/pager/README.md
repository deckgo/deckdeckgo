## Getting Started

To get started with this Web Component, have a look to its [documentation](hhttps://docs.deckdeckgo.com/deck/pager/).

## Limitation

This pager only works in a single page presentation because it listens to events emitted by the deck on the `document` level.

## Develop

To develop and run this Web Component locally, proceed as following:

```
git clone https://github.com/deckgo/deckdeckgo
cd deckdeckgo/webcomponents/pager
npm install
npm run start
```
