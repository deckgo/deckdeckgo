# deckgo-demo

Display your apps or websites inside an Android or iOS frame.

It is inspired and based on the awesome [work](https://github.com/ionic-team/ionic-docs/tree/c5a624ac35d5285b871e7d8513d3849bdea63271/src/components/demo) of the [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com/) team.

## Installation

This component can be added to your web application with following methods.

> If you are using our Starter Kit, no need to worry about this, this component is included, therefore you could skip the "Installation" chapter.

### Using from a CDN

It's recommended to use [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/) to use the [DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com) lazy image component from a CDN. To do so, add the following include script in the main HTML file of your project:

```
<script type="module" src="https://unpkg.com/@deckdeckgo/demo@latest/dist/deckdeckgo-demo/deckdeckgo-demo.esm.js"></script>
```

### Install from NPM

Install it in your project from [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@deckdeckgo/demo) using the following command:

```bash
npm install @deckdeckgo/demo
```

### Framework integration

The [Stencil documentation](https://stenciljs.com/docs/overview) provide examples of framework integration for [Angular](https://stenciljs.com/docs/angular), [React](https://stenciljs.com/docs/react), [Vue](https://stenciljs.com/docs/vue) and [Ember](https://stenciljs.com/docs/ember).

That being said, commonly, you might either `import` or `load` it:

#### Import

```
import '@deckdeckgo/demo';
```

#### Loader

```
import { defineCustomElements as deckDeckGoElement } from '@deckdeckgo/demo/dist/loader';
deckDeckGoElement();
```

## Usage

The "Demo" Web Component could be integrated using the tag `<deckgo-demo/>`.

```
<deckgo-demo src="https://deckdeckgo.app"></deckgo-demo>
```
