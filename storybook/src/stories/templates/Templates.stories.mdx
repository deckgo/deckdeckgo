# Templates

[DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com) is a deck of slides. Each of these is based on a template which has its own layout and behaviour.

Their content can be edited and structured using `slots` and other attributes.

The deck itself is declared using the tag `<deckgo-deck/>` and each slides can be added as its children.

```
<deckgo-deck>
  <deckgo-slide-title>
    <h1 slot="title">The first slide</h1>
    <p slot="content">
      Hello World ðŸš€
    </p>
  </deckgo-slide-title>

  <deckgo-slide-content>
      <h1 slot="title">The second slide</h1>
  </deckgo-slide-content>
</deckgo-deck>
```

In the previous example, the presentation contains two slides. The first slide use the template `deckgo-slide-title` and the second slide use the template `deckgo-slide-content`.

# Installation

The core component (`<deckgo-deck/>`) does not contain any slides. These have to be explicitly installed and imported. Doing so, only these, which you are actually using, are going to be bundled in your presentations.

> If you are using the Starter Kit, all default templates, are pre-installed and pre-imported.

# Resources

[DeckDeckGo](https://deckdeckgo.com) provides a set of default templates, those listed in this section hereafter. More templates are also available thanks to the wonderful work of the [community](https://github.com/deckgo-community).

In addition, you can create you own custom templates and even use these in our [editor](https://app.deckdeckgo.com). Checkout the [template-kit](https://github.com/deckgo/template-kit) to get started.
