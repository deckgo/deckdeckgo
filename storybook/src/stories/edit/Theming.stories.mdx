# Theming

Theming a [DeckDeckGo] presentation is quick and easy.

## Theme

To create the theme for your deck when you are using the [DeckDeckGo] starter kit, use the [Ionic Color Generator](https://ionicframework.com/docs/theming/color-generator) to pick the colors of your choice.

Once done, `copy` the generated CSS variables and `paste` them into the `src/css/variables.css` file of your presentation.

Finally, edit the `index.html` and replace the color of the `body` background.

```
body {
    background: #3880ff;
}
```

> This background color is defined directly in the index.html file because it is the one which will be applied until your presentation is loaded

## Custom styles

[DeckDeckGo] also offers various theming options which could be set using CSS variables and which are described in their respective slides' templates, see chapter [concept](/slides/concept) to begin with.

## Notes

If you think we missed or need further theming options, don't hesitate to open an issue and/or submit a PR, it would be my pleasure to add more theming flexibility and options.
