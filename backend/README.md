# DeckDeckGo - Backend

This project is a backend for [DeckDeckGo].

It acts as the signaling server to let [DeckDeckGo]'s peers establish a real-time communication channel using [WebRTC](https://webrtc.org) for the remote control.

It also transmits the information for the live voting when you are interacting with your audience.
