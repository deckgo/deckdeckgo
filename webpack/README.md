## Webpack Markdown Plugin

This Webpack plugin has for goal to convert your presentation written in Markdown to HTML including the [DeckDeckGo] tags and markers.

For the Markdown parsing itself, the [remarkable](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/remarkable) parser is used under the hood. In the particular case of this plugin, it will be extended in order to enhance it with the following abilities:

1. Parse all images with **lazy loading** support
2. Allow the parsing of [Ionic](https://ionicframework.com) and [DeckDeckGo] html tags

## Webpack Info Plugin

This Webpack plugin is a simple plugin which has for goal to display some information after the build has completed.

## Webpack Notes Plugin

This Webpack plugin has for goal to remove your notes from your presentation, notably useful when you will run a production build before publishing your presentation online.

## Getting Started
