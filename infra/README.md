## Getting started

**requirements: [Nix]**

To (re)deploy the infrastructure, run the following commands:

```shell
$ cd infra/
$ nix-shell
$ terraform apply
```

Running `nix-shell` drops you in a shell where all the dependencies are
available. Running `terraform apply` will package everything needed by the
lambda function and upload it to AWS. **NOTE**: if you are deploying from a new
machine you may need to run `terraform init`.
